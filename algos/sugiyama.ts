/*
 * Given a directed graph (digraph) G.V; E/ with a set of vertices Vand a set of edges E,the Sugiyama algorithm solves the problem of Ô¨Ånding a 2D
 * hierarchical drawing of G subject to thefollowing readability requirements:
 * (a) Vertices are drawn on horizontal lines without overlapping; each line represents a level in thehierarchy; all edges point downwards.
 * (b) Short-span edges (i.e., edges between adjacent levels) are drawn with straight lines.
 * (c) Long-span edges (i.e., edges between nonadjacent levels) are drawn as close to straight linesas possible.
 * (d) The number of edge crossings is the minimum.(e) Vertices connected to each other are placed as close to each other as possible.
 * (f) The layout of edges coming into (or going out of) a vertex is balanced, i.e., edges are evenlyspaced around a common target (or source) vertex.
